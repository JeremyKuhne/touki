[![Build](https://github.com/JeremyKuhne/touki/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JeremyKuhne/touki/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

Provides useful functionality both for .NET and .NET Framework applications.

Tōki (登器) is the Japanese word for (Ninja) "climbing gear" or "climbing equipment". This library is designed to help
developers "climb" the challenges of cross framework .NET development by providing tools and utilities that enhance
performance and efficiency.

Some of the design goals include:

- Avoiding unnecessary allocations
- Avoiding code that prevents AOT compilation on .NET
- Leveraging the latest C# (14+) features to improve usability and performance

## Features

- Non allocating interpolated string support on .NET Framework (`$"Age: {age}"`)
- Formatting directly into `Stream` and `TextWriter` without unnecessary allocations
- Robust and performant `StringSegment` struct for working with substrings without allocations
- `SpanReader` and `SpanWriter` for efficient reading and writing of data in spans
- `BufferScope<T>` for easy management of temporary `ArrayPool` and stack based buffers
- `Value` struct for creating strongly typed arbitrary collections of values without boxing most primitives
- Much more!
