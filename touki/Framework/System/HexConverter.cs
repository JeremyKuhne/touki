            // The offset of 48 for each bit is necessary so that the entire range fits in 64 bits.
            // First, we subtract '0' to the input digit (after casting to uint to account for any
            // negative inputs). Note that even if this subtraction underflows, this happens before
            // the result is zero-extended to ulong, meaning that `i` will always have upper 32 bits
            // equal to 0. We then left shift the constant with this offset, and apply a bitmask that
            // has the highest bit set (the sign bit) if and only if `c` is in the ['0', '0' + 64) range.
            // Then we only need to check whether this final result is less than 0: this will only be
            // the case if both `i` was in fact the index of a set bit in the magic constant, and also
            // `c` was in the allowed range (this ensures that false positive bit shifts are ignored).
